# Call for Papers — EMSE Special Issue for the “International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025)”

A special issue of the [Empirical Software Engineering Journal](http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10664).

## Editors of the Special Issue

- Maria Teresa Baldassarre, (University of Bari, Italy), mariateresa.baldassarre@uniba.it;
- Masud Rahman, (Dalhousie University, Canada), masud.rahman@dal.ca.

## Description of the Special Issue
Software analysis, evolution, and reengineering encompass the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems, the exploration of innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and the examination of innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding. 

The special issue invites submissions on novel and innovative research results and industrial experience papers in the area of software analysis, evolution, and reengineering. We especially encourage the submissions of extended papers from the 32nd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025). 

The evaluation of papers will be based on the following:
- Underlying methodological soundness and rigour;
- Novelty of the work;
- The quality of the reporting;
- Strength of empirical evaluation/basis;
- Significance and reproducibility of the results.
