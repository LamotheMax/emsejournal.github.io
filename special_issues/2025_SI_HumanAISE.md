## Description of the Special Issue
While AI-driven tools are increasingly common in SE for tasks like code
generation, code summarization, testing, and bug detection, they often
focus primarily on automation and efficiency rather than complementing
human developers' workflows, decision-making processes, and cognitive
needs. 
Issues such as bias, transparency, accountability, and fairness
remain underexplored, making it essential for the SE community to engage
in responsible AI design and deployment. As AI advances, developers must
adapt to new ways of interacting with AI-powered tools, raising
questions about how to create a symbiotic human-AI ecosystem in SE. 
The future of SE relies on AI that enhances human creativity, productivity,
and decision-making rather than replacing it. 
To address this need, the
Special Issue on Human-Centered AI for Software Engineering (HumanAISE)
invites research that investigates key challenges and opportunities in
developing AI tools that integrate seamlessly into SE workflows. We seek
contributions that examine how AI can augment and collaborate with human
expertise in SE while ensuring transparency, fairness, and ethical
AI-assisted development.


### Topics of Interest
We invite high-quality research that investigates the following (but not
limited to) topics:

- **Knowledge Transfer and Human-Guided AI for SE:** Exploring the
  exchange of knowledge between human and AI systems, focusing on how AI
  can learn from human expertise and provide insights to developers.
  Topics may include empirical studies on the needs, preferences, and
  challenges of providing human feedback, as well as technical
  approaches for integrating human input to improve SE tasks and empower
  AI with human guidance.

- **Human-AI Interaction/Collaboration for SE:** Research on how humans
  and AI systems collaborate during software development. Topics may
  include empirical studies on how developers use AI tools in practice
  and interaction models, workflows, and interfaces that enhance the
  collaboration between developers and AI.

- **Explainable AI for SE:** Research on making AI systems more
  transparent and understandable for software engineers. Topics may
  include studies to understand the needs of developers for explainable
  AI and techniques to improve the interpretability of AI decisions,
  allowing developers to trust and effectively apply AI in their tasks.

- **Ethics, Fairness, and Biases in AI-driven Models for SE:** Studies
  addressing the ethical implications of AI in SE, focusing on
  identifying and mitigating biases in AI-driven tools, ensuring
  fairness, and establishing ethical standards for AI's role in software
  engineering.


- **SE Education with AI:** The role of AI in SE education, including
  AI-driven tools, intelligent tutoring systems, and methods for
  integrating AI into SE curricula to enhance learning.

- **SE Practices for AI:** Research on how SE practices can support AI
  development and maintenance. This includes understanding developer-AI
  interactions and improving the development process of AI systems
  leveraging human aspects.

- **Evaluation of Human-AI systems in SE:** Research on the evaluation
  design for systems that involve Human-AI interactions. For instance,
  what data needs to be collected to show the long-term effectiveness of
  such systems.
